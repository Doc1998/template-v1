                The world of <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/10009/web-design">web design</a> and <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/website-development">web development</a> can be a confusing one, especially if you're not sure what the difference is between the two. In this article, we'll explore the difference between web design and web development, the skills you need for each, and the benefits of each  for Irish business owners.

                The Skills You Need for Web Design
            </h3>
            <p> 
                If you want to be a web designer, you'll need to have a good eye for aesthetics and typography. You'll also need to be proficient in implementing important structures into your websites such as <a href="https://www.oberlo.com/ecommerce-wiki/conversion-funnel#:~:text=A%20Conversion%20Funnel%20is%20an,guided%20through%20the%20conversion%20path.">conversion funnels</a>. A good web designer should also have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.

                In addition to these technical skills, a good web designer should also have strong communication and project management skills. They should be able to work with clients to understand their needs and then translate those needs into a well-designed website.

                The Skills You Need for Web Development
            </h3>
            <p>
                If you want to be a web developer, you'll need to have strong technical skills. You'll need to be proficient in programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A good web developer should also have a strong understanding of server-side technologies like Java and MySQL.

                In addition to strong technical skills, web developers need to be good at problem solving. They need to be able to debug code and find solutions to complex problems. Web developers also need to have good communication skills. They need to be able to explain their code to other developers and clients, and implement the structures given to them by the web designer.

                The Importance of Web Design
            </h3>
            <p>
                When landing on a website, most users will judge a businesses reliability based on their impressions of the businesses website design. A poorly designed website can make people question your legitimacy and lead to less conversions. Professional web design is important to maximise the benefits a website can bring to your business.

            <p>
               Often Web developers with poor technical skills use page builders such as <a href="https://irelandwebdesigns.ie/articles/2022/wordpress-is-bad-for-SEO-and-customer-experience">WordPress</a> to build their websites. Wordpress websites are often poorly mobile optimised and have slow
               page speeds. These poor <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2021/07/08/what-are-googles-new-core-web-vitals--why-should-your-business-care-about-them/">core vital metrics</a> can lead to your website dropping in the search rankings bringing less customers to your website.
