          <p>I am the owner and lead developer at Ireland Web Designs. I’m from Charleville, Cork, I love sports and I have been studying Computer Science and programming for 5 years. I have a BSc in Computer Systems from the University of Limerick. </p>
          <p>My goal is to provide businesses with fast websites that require no maintenance from the business owner and are built for conversion.
            What I found was that a lot of small businesses don't have the funds to spend thousands upfront on a new website. And the ones that did, got taken advantage of having terrible slow websites with awful design that was clearly made using out of box solutions by someone who had never seen a line of code . Business owners are in a frustrating position. They are forced to break the bank to get a nice functioning website and risk being taken advantage of by awful web designers. That's how I came up with my €0 down and €149 a month model. It's more manageable for a small business to handle, they will have support for the complete lifetime of their website and it would never go out of date or require learning how to manage websites.
