                    WordPress is a common content management system (CMS) . Many people with little knowledge of Web Development launch their websites with WordPress because it’s easy to use and free to download. However, WordPress websites have very slow speed scores, they are not built mobile optimized and often are made without considering web design principles. Here is why you should be using a hand coded website if you want your business to thrive

                    WordPress is not good for SEO
                </h3>
                <p>
                    WordPress is not a search engine optimization (SEO) optimized platform out of the box. This is one of the main reasons why you should not use it if you want your site to rank on Google’s first couple of pages. A WordPress website will not have the proper code or optimization that Google’s algorithm requires to rank a website. Many websites created using WordPress are not even close to being Google’s standard for SEO best practices. Many WordPress developers sell poorly optimized websites because they do not have an understanding of how SEO works and they do not possess the technical skills to produce fast high performing websites.

                    WordPress is bad for user experience
                </h3>
                <p> 
                    WordPress is not built for speed or performance. You should never use WordPress for a high-traffic website because it will slow to a crawl and frustrate your visitors. WordPress is not built to be fast, it is built to be flexible and easy to use. This makes WordPress websites slow and cumbersome. When Google’s search engine engineers built the algorithm that decides what websites to rank on the first page, they built it to prioritize speed and performance. Google is constantly testing its algorithm. It is always evolving to give users the best experience when they search. This includes prioritizing websites with a fast load time. If your website is built using WordPress you may rank lower on Google which could give your competitors a huge advantage.

                    WordPress websites are slow
                </h3>
                <p>
                    A dynamic website built with WordPress will always be slower than a static site built by a professional web designer. A static site is built using HTML code to create the site. The code is then saved on the server and does not change. When you load a static site, your browser is what reads and compiles the code for the website and loads it instantly, one of the best ways to make a static site is to code it by hand (which is what we do best!).

                    The problem with dynamic websites such as WordPress is that the server takes more time to check the database and put everything together. The more bloated plug-ins you have on your website the more you will slow it down. Static sites, however, can load up to 10 times faster than a dynamic website, everything is already prebuilt, so all the browser has to do is load it and throw it at us. Every line of code I write to build my websites are there because they are needed with no wasteful unnecessary bloat. WordPress websites are full of bloated messy code which only slows down their load times even more. The benchmark load time for a website is 2 seconds. Slow poorly optimized websites with greater than 3 second load times experience a 50% higher bounce rate, 22% fewer page visits and most importantly 22% lower conversions against faster loading website pages. 75% of users leave after 4 seconds of load times. My websites load in under 0.5 seconds, significantly lower than the average.

                    WordPress Themes are often not mobile-friendly
                </h3>
                <p>
                    If you’re not familiar with what “mobile-friendly” means, it’s a term that Google came up with in 2012 to describe how well a website is optimized for viewing on mobile devices. Any website that is not mobile-friendly will not be included in Google’s mobile search results. This means that if you have a mobile-friendly website, you’ll be included in Google’s mobile search results, but if you have a site that isn’t mobile-friendly, you won’t be included in Google’s mobile search results at all.

                    Summing up
                </h3>
                <p>
                    If you’re running a business, you know that it’s essential to have a strong online presence. The best way to do that is by creating a website. It’s important to choose a professional who knows SEO and has highly proficient programming skills. There are plenty of reasons why you might want to consider building a site from scratch instead of using WordPress. If you’re serious about growing your business, you’ll want your website to be as effective as possible. A custom-built site will provide a better user experience, be more mobile friendly, and be easier to rank in search engines. If you want to succeed online, you need a website. But if you want to be successful, you need a website that succeeds.
